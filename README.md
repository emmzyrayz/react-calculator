Hello and welcome to my first ever React program, a simple calculator!

As a junior web developer, I'm excited to share this project with you. This calculator was built using React and includes basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

You can find the source code for this calculator on my GitHub repository. Feel free to take a look and give me your feedback!

To run this calculator on your local machine, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you've cloned the repository, run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Then, you can start the app by running npm start and open it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

I hope you find this calculator helpful and easy to use. Thank you for checking out my project and stay tuned for more exciting projects in the future!
